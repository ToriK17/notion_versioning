# JWT Parts in-depth

### **Header**

The **header** is the first part of a JWT and typically contains two pieces of information:

- The type of token (`JWT`)
- The signing algorithm used (e.g., `HS256`, `RS256`)
It is a JSON object that is Base64-encoded.

**Example**

```jsx
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

For that typ, there are others like:

- `"typ": "JWE"` – for **JSON Web Encryption** (encrypted tokens)
- `"typ": "JWS"` – for **JSON Web Signature** (signed tokens, not necessarily in JWT format)

These all follow the same general format, as defined by the **JOSE** standards:

- **JOSE = JSON Object Signing and Encryption**
- Includes JWT, JWS, JWE, JWK (JSON Web Key), JWA (JSON Web Algorithms)

### **Payload**

The **payload** contains the actual data, or "claims," about the user and any other information the token is carrying. Claims can be:

- **Registered claims** like `sub`, `iat`, `exp`
- **Custom claims** defined by the app
It is also a JSON object that is Base64-encoded, and it's **not encrypted**, just encoded.

**Example:**

```jsx
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "Tori",
  "admin": true
}
```

### **Signature**

The **signature** is the key part that **protects the data from tampering**.

It is a cryptographic hash that is generated by signing (using HMAC or RSA):

```
HMAC-SHA256(
  Base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + Base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret or private key
)
```

The signature proves that the token **hasn’t been altered** and **came from the expected source**.
