# GO Backend

Thus far the organizational structure can feel a bit more open-ended in Go.

**Creating Structure:**

- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Try to logically separate your code into `handlers` (for request handling and routing logic), `models` (for data structures), and `db` (for database interactions). This is a fundamental principle of good software design.
- **Modularity:** Each directory represents a specific layer or functionality, making it easier to navigate and maintain your codebase as it grows.

**General Opinions on Structure in Go Applications:** 

- **Flexibility is Key:** Unlike the "convention over configuration" philosophy of Rails, Go offers more flexibility in how you structure your projects. This can be both a strength and a potential pitfall. It allows for tailoring the structure to the specific needs of your application but requires more conscious decisions.
- **Layered Architecture is Common:** Separating your application into layers (like handlers, services, models, data access) is a widely accepted and recommended practice in Go. This promotes maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns.
- **"Flat is better until it isn't":** For smaller projects, it's often okay to keep things relatively flat. Over-engineering the structure too early can add unnecessary complexity. However, as your application grows, more explicit organization becomes crucial.
- **Context Matters:** The ideal structure can depend on the size and complexity of your application. A small utility might have a single `main.go` file, while a larger API might have a more elaborate structure.
- **Focus on Packages:** Go's package system (`go.mod` and import paths) is central to organizing code. Your directory structure should generally align with your package structure. Each directory often corresponds to a distinct Go package.
- **Dependency Management:** Using `go.mod` for managing dependencies is standard practice in modern Go projects. Your inclusion of this file is correct.

Basic Setup for Creating a Sample Project to get a feel for GO:

- Begin by initing the app: `go mod init <app name>`
- Add a framework (Gin is pretty popular) `go get [github.com/gin-gonic/gin](http://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)`
- Then create your basic structure, main.go, handlers, models, db
- To create the actual db, you can just instantiate one and add it’s address to the `connect.go` where it can be used elsewhere.
- Then you can organize and keep migrations (same as rails) by downloading and using: `brew install golang-migrate`
- Then you can create migrations like so: `migrate create -ext sql -dir db/migrations -seq create_products_and_sales_tables`
- And run them like so: `migrate -path db/migrations -database "postgres://localhost:5432/<db_name>?sslmode=disable" up`
- Routes: In a Go application using the Gin web framework, the **`main.go`** file is the conventional and primary place where you define your application's routes.

Resource Management

### Resource Cleanup in Go: Close It or Regret It

In Go, if you open it, you better close it. Files, network connections, database rows, and these things don’t clean up after themselves. If you forget to call `.Close()`, you’re not just being messy, you’re hoarding OS resources.

**What Needs Closing:**

- **Files** (`os.Open()`, `os.Create()`): Opens give you a file descriptor. Closes give it back to the OS. Forgetting? Hello, "too many open files" error.
- **Network Connections** (`net.Dial()`): Sockets don’t grow on trees. Close them or prepare for sadness.
- **Database Stuff** (`sql.Rows`, etc.): Even with a connection pool, each query can hog memory and connections until you `.Close()` it.
- **Processes & Timers**: Spawned processes and timers (`time.NewTimer()`) can leak if not explicitly shut down.
- **Misc Stuff**: Some image decoders, writers, or other library types have a `Close()` too. Respect it.

**Use `defer` Like a Pro:**

Always write something like this: `defer f.Close()`

So no matter how your function exits (even in chaos), the close still happens. It's like putting your trash in the bin before the critters get to it.

**What does not Need Closing:**

- `db.DB.Exec` `Exec()` does not return a `*Rows` or `*Row` object that holds open a cursor or result set.
- `db.DB.QueryRow` `QueryRow()`, which returns a single-row wrapper. Still **no `.Close()` needed here**, because `QueryRow()` calls `.Close()` **internally** after `.Scan()` is called. It’s kind of the one polite guest at the Go party.
