# The Set Builtin

The **set** command lets you set options, or flags, for your shell session. These flags control the way that the shell handles certain situations.

**`set` in Bash is like flipping switches** that change how your shell behaves.

The format is: `set -[flags]`

or to turn something *off*: `set +[flags]`

Contrary to what you might expect, `-` means on, and `+` means off. Yes, that’s backward. Yes, it’s annoying. Yes, Bash is a weird old man.

### **Options / Key Flags you should care about**

### `e`

**“Error? We out.”** If **any command fails** (returns non-zero), the script **quits** immediately.

Exits the script immediately if a command fails.

Why? Because continuing on after a failure is how you end up deleting your root folder or emailing your password to a mailing list. This is great for catching bugs early, not letting your script wander off into disaster territory.

**`set -e` does *not* exit the script when a failing command is:**

- In an `if` test: `if my_command; then ...` ← totally normal to check failure
- In a `while` or `until` loop condition
- In a pipeline, **unless it’s the last command**: `cmd1 | cmd2` ← if `cmd1` fails, it’s ignored
- Part of a `&&` or `||` chain, except the last part
- Run inside a function or subshell **that was started when `e` was being ignored**
- Inverted with `!` (like `! my_command`)

### `a`

**“Export everything like Oprah.”**

Any variable you set is automatically exported to child processes.

Like: `MYVAR=value  # usually only exists in current shell`

But with `-a`, anything you touch becomes part of the environment.

> You set a variable? Now your subprocesses have it too. Bash is yelling “YOU get an ENV VAR!” at every assignment.
> 

Use case? Almost none. It's like defaulting every variable to global in a JavaScript file from 2008. Avoid unless you're writing weird science experiments.

### `b`

**“Background job died? Tell me NOW.”**

Normally when you run something in the background (`some_command &`), Bash waits to tell you it’s done until after you press Enter again.

With `-b`, Bash screams the second the background job finishes. Even if you’re not ready. Even if you’re emotionally unprepared.

> Kinda like your friend texting “we need to talk” at 2am instead of just waiting till morning.
> 

Use it if you’re babysitting background jobs. Otherwise, forget it exists.

### `u`

**“Undefined variable? HOW DARE YOU.”**

Treats any usage of an unset variable as an error. This is your friend if you want to avoid typos like `$usre` when you meant `$user`.

> Combine this with -e for fun and trauma: `set -eu`
> 

### `o pipefail`

**“Pipelines shouldn't lie.”**

Normally, only the *last* command in a pipeline matters. If the earlier ones fail, Bash shrugs.

With `pipefail`, **any** failure in the chain makes the whole thing fail:
`cat file.txt | grep "foo" | sort`

If `cat file.txt` fails because the file’s missing, `pipefail` lets that kill the script instead of pretending it’s fine.

### Config I Probably Want in Every Script:

`set -euo pipefail` 

**Translation:**

- `e`: die on error
- `u`: die if you use an undefined variable
- `o pipefail`: die if anything in a pipeline fails
