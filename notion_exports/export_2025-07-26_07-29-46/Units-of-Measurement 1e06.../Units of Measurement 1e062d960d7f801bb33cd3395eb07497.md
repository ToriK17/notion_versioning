# Units of Measurement

- **Teraflops (TFLOPs)** are a unit of measurement that indicate the computational power of a system, specifically its ability to perform floating-point operations per second. A teraflop represents one trillion (1,000,000,000,000) floating-point operations per second.
    - TFLOPs are often used to measure the computational power of GPUs, particularly in gaming and AI applications. A higher TFLOP rating generally indicates a faster system capable of handling more complex calculations and tasks. Higher TFLOPs allow GPUs to render more detailed and smoother graphics in video games and other visually intensive applications.
    - Common uses: Rendering Graphics, Data Processing, AI and Machine Learning, Scientific Simulations,
- **Floating-Point Operations (FLOPs):** These are mathematical operations involving numbers with decimal points, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
