# Routes

Stylistically we have a couple ways of writing routes.

Option A: The explicit route `post "login", to: "sessions#create"` 

Option B: Resourceful Route `resources :sessions, only: [:create]` 

### What `resources :sessions` Actually Does

When you have `resources :sessions, only: [:create]` all this does is generate `POST /sessions → sessions#create` 

BUT—it’s being wrapped in a whole philosophical framework:

- RESTful conventions
- "Sessions are a resource, and you're creating one"
- Reusability (if you later add `destroy`, you get `DELETE /sessions`)
- Consistency across your whole app

### What `post "login"` Does

You get: `POST /login → sessions#create` 

But semantically, it’s just:

- A verb (`login`) not a resource
- A one-off custom route
- Not RESTful, but arguably more intuitive for human users
- Great for APIs, CLIs, or routes users *actually see and type*

### Comparison Chart: `resources` vs Custom `post`

| Feature | `resources :sessions` | `post "login"` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🔄 RESTful | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| 🧠 Semantics | You're "creating a session" | You're "logging in" |
| 🤓 Convention | Rails-style | YOLO-style |
| 🧍 Human-readable | Feels formal and abstract | Feels familiar and direct |
| 🤖 API-friendliness | Can feel overly "enterprisey" | Friendly for CLI or JSON APIs |
| 💪 Extensibility | Easy to add `destroy`, `show`, etc. | Custom logic for every route |
| 🧹 Cleanliness | Controller logic is assumed | Everything is explicit |
| 🔮 Auto-generated route helper | `sessions_path` | `login_path` |

### 🔮  More about Auto-generated Route Helper

List them all with `bin/rails routes` 

Helpers Exist for ALL Named Routes, meaning *any* route where you use `as:` or define it cleanly will generate a route helper.

so this: `post "login", to: "sessions#create", as: :login` will give you `login_path, login_url` 

What resources does give you (when you don’t limit it) is a bunch of helpers automatically:

- `new_session_path`
- `edit_session_path`
- `session_path(id)`
- `sessions_path`

All based on conventional REST patterns. It’s less about **one helper** and more about the **entire resource ecosystem**.

### 🧭 MEMBER vs COLLECTION Routes

These are like the *“are we talking about one thing, or all the things?”* routing options.

**`member` routes:**

- Act **on ONE resource**
- Need an `:id`
- Example: `GET /users/:id/activate`

```ruby
resources :users do
  member do
    post :activate
    get :dashboard
  end
end
```

It produces routes like: `POST   /users/:id/activate`  & `GET    /users/:id/dashboard`

**`collection` routes:**

- Act **on the WHOLE group**
- No `:id`
- Example: `GET /users/search`

```ruby
resources :users do
  collection do
    get :search
    post :import
  end
end
```

It produces: `GET    /users/search` & `POST   /users/import` 

Recap:

- `member` = *“Do this thing to this specific item.”*
- `collection` = *“Do this thing to all or the general set of items.”*

## 🧩 Custom Routes with Constraints

Sometimes you're like: *“Only let this route work if the moon is full and the ID is numeric and the user is worthy.”*

We touched on custom routes, this is with constraints: `get 'products/:id', to: 'products#show', constraints: { id: /\d+/ }`

## 🧼 Concerns in Routes (for DRYness)

Concerns are Rails' way of saying, *“Okay, you’ve repeated yourself five times. Please seek help.”*

### Use them to extract reusable chunks of routing.

```ruby
# routes.rb
concern :commentable do
  resources :comments
end

resources :posts, concerns: :commentable
resources :photos, concerns: :commentable
```

Now both `posts` and `photos` get `/comments`

Also you can stack them: `resources :articles, concerns: [:commentable, :likable]`
