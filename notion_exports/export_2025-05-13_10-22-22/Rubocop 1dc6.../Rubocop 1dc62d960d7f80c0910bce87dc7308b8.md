# Rubocop

Rules that makes sense:

**Style/FrozenStringLiteralComment**

This requires you to add this line: `frozen_string_literal: true` to the beginning of each file

Why? It freezes string literals so Ruby doesn't have to duplicate them.

**Style/GlobalStdStream** 

Use `$stdin` instead of `STDIN`. It's literally the same thing, but RuboCop thinks you’re yelling when you type `STDIN`. Don’t be a Princess Donut on this one.

**Style/MutableConstant**

Freeze your constants like a responsible adult: `SERVICE = "toknsmith".freeze`
