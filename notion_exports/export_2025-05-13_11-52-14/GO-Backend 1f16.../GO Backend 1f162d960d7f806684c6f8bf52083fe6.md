# GO Backend

Thus far the organizational structure can feel a bit more open-ended in Go.

**Creating Structure:**

- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Try to logically separate your code into `handlers` (for request handling and routing logic), `models` (for data structures), and `db` (for database interactions). This is a fundamental principle of good software design.
- **Modularity:** Each directory represents a specific layer or functionality, making it easier to navigate and maintain your codebase as it grows.

**General Opinions on Structure in Go Applications:**

- **Flexibility is Key:** Unlike the "convention over configuration" philosophy of Rails, Go offers more flexibility in how you structure your projects. This can be both a strength and a potential pitfall. It allows for tailoring the structure to the specific needs of your application but requires more conscious decisions.
- **Layered Architecture is Common:** Separating your application into layers (like handlers, services, models, data access) is a widely accepted and recommended practice in Go. This promotes maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns.
- **"Flat is better until it isn't":** For smaller projects, it's often okay to keep things relatively flat. Over-engineering the structure too early can add unnecessary complexity. However, as your application grows, more explicit organization becomes crucial.
- **Context Matters:** The ideal structure can depend on the size and complexity of your application. A small utility might have a single `main.go` file, while a larger API might have a more elaborate structure.
- **Focus on Packages:** Go's package system (`go.mod` and import paths) is central to organizing code. Your directory structure should generally align with your package structure. Each directory often corresponds to a distinct Go package.
- **Dependency Management:** Using `go.mod` for managing dependencies is standard practice in modern Go projects. Your inclusion of this file is correct.

Basic Setup for Creating a Sample Project to get a feel for GO:

- Begin by initing the app: `go mod init <app name>`
- Add a framework (Gin is pretty popular) `go get [github.com/gin-gonic/gin](http://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)`
- Then create your basic structure, main.go, handlers, models, db
- To create the actual db, you can just instantiate one and add itâ€™s address to the `connect.go` where it can be used elsewhere.
- Then you can organize and keep migrations (same as rails) by downloading and using: `brew install golang-migrate`
- Then you can create migrations like so: `migrate create -ext sql -dir db/migrations -seq create_products_and_sales_tables`
- And run them like so: `migrate -path db/migrations -database "postgres://localhost:5432/<db_name>?sslmode=disable" up`

More GO stuff to know:

- := The gopher face operator is about declaration and initialization. It must be used inside of a function,
