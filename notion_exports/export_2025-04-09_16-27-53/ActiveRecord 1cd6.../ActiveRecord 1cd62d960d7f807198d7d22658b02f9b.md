# ActiveRecord

### How ActiveRecord Works Under the Hood

ActiveRecord is Rails’ ORM—**Object-Relational Mapping**. It turns database rows into Ruby objects, so you can manipulate your data with Ruby instead of writing SQL directly.

**But what’s actually going on?**

When you call something like `User.find(1)`, ActiveRecord:

1. **Builds an SQL query** from your method call (`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1`)
2. **Sends it to the database** using an adapter (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
3. **Receives the result as a hash**
4. **Instantiates a Ruby object (`User`), populates it with that data**

Rails creates these objects **dynamically**, using metaprogramming to define methods like `user.name` or `user.email` **based on the column names** in the database. That’s why `User` classes often have no methods—you don’t need them. They’re created on the fly.

### Caching, dirty tracking, and change detection

- ActiveRecord tracks changes to each attribute via an internal state hash (`@changed_attributes`).
- This is how `.changed?` and `.save` know whether to run an UPDATE query or not.

### Query chaining

- Calls like `User.where(role: 'admin').order(:created_at).limit(5)` don’t immediately hit the DB.
- Instead, they build an `ActiveRecord::Relation`, which **lazily evaluates** when needed (e.g., `.to_a`, `.each`, or when rendering in a view).
- This enables chaining and reduces unnecessary DB calls.

### Scopes in Rails & when would you use them

Scopes are chain-able class methods, that encapsulate repeated database queries in a reusable way. 

For example: 

```jsx
class Post < ApplicationRecord
scope :published, -> { where(published: true) }
scope :recent, -> { order(created_at: :desc).limit(5) }
end
```

Post.published.recent

I can use them to keep my codebase clean instead of repeating raw query logic, I can call `Post.published.recent`, which is much easier to read and test. I also like that scopes return `ActiveRecord::Relation`, so they can be lazily evaluated and chained.

Scopes are great for **query encapsulation** and **readability**, especially in complex business logic. They are preferable over long chained queries in controllers or services.

### Validations

Rails validations ensure data integrity before data is saved to the database. They live in the model layer.

Simple Validation:

```jsx
class User < ApplicationRecord
  validates :email, presence: true, uniqueness: true
  validates :age, numericality: { greater_than_or_equal_to: 18 }
end
```

Custom Validation:

```jsx
validate :must_have_valid_domain

def must_have_valid_domain
  errors.add(:email, "must be from example.com") unless email&.ends_with?("@example.com")
end
```
