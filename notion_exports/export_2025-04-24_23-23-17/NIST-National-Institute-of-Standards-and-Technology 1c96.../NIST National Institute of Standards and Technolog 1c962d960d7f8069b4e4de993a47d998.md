# NIST:  National Institute of Standards and Technology

### Who are they?

- **Part of the U.S. Department of Commerce**
- Funded by the **federal government**
- They create tech standards — from **cryptographic algorithms** to **weights and measures**
- Basically: they’re the people who tell the world, “This encryption algorithm is safe to use.”

### 🚀 NIST and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)

**Status:**

- NIST has been running a multi-year public contest to standardize **post-quantum algorithms**
- In 2022, they **selected 4 finalists**:
    - **CRYSTALS-Kyber** (encryption)
    - **CRYSTALS-Dilithium**, **FALCON**, **SPHINCS+** (signatures)
- Draft standards for some were released in **2023**
- **Official standards expected in 2024–2025**

These will eventually replace (or supplement) RSA, ECDSA, etc., to keep data safe even in a world with quantum computers.
